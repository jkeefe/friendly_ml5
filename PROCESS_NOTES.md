# Process Notes

From the Eyeo class by Hannah Davis at EYEO, June 2019

## Getting Started

Forked & downloaded the class code from [Hannah's repo](https://github.com/handav/friendly_ml5).

Got a node server running based on [this guide](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).

```
cd [working directory]
npm init --yes
npm install http-server
http-server
```

Then opened http://127.0.0.1:8080

Navigated to `starting_template` folder where the `index.html` loaded.
